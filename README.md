## API Process Flow
1. Problem Processing (Sentiment Analysis, Problem Prioritization)
2. Similarity Search
3. Question Answering
4. Translation
5. Response

### Problem Processing
This process works by taking in the user inquiry as content to be analyzed and revised to be used by the API as the basis for the overall process. By segmenting the content into separate sentences, the AI model that the API uses can perform a sentiment analysis and rank them according to the severity of the sentiment. Then, after the sentiment analysis, based on the level of severity, the model can now re-arrange the content, addressing the higher level first Â and the lowest level last.

### Similarity Search
The AI model performs an index of the given documents and searches for possible matches against the user's inquiry.

- - -

### Question Answering
As the name suggests, the AI model now tries to generate an answer to the user's inquiry based on the searched documents, making the response as straightforward as possible.

### Translation
This feature is optional for the company to use. But if the company wishes to use it, through a third-party translator, the API can have access to translate into over 103 languages.

## Installation
This installation guide will walk you through the process of setting up the chatbot on your system. Installation is fairly straightforward; you can have two options for installation. You can have a server send POST requests to the API behind the chatbot or have it integrated to your website.

### Server POST Request
1. Extract the chatbot API to your server.
2. In your console, type and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
3. You are required to create a `.env` file that contains your OpenAI API Key and your selected port to be exposed by express.
    1. See `example.env`.
4. Copy over all your support documents inside the `/support` folder.
    1. By default, the chatbot API is already trained to answer from [Converge ICT Support Page](https://www.convergeict.com/support/).
5. To run the chatbot API, in your console, type and run `npm start`.
6. The console will output the exposed address of the chatbot API to be used as your endpoint.
    1. Your endpoint address should be `http:localhost:<port>/aid-post`
7. You now have successfully set up the chatbot API and is now ready to receive POST requests.

### Integrated
1. Extract the chatbot API to your website's internal folder.
2. In your console, type and run `npm install` to install all required dependencies.
3. You may need to modify the `index.js` to have an export of the otherwise POST endpoint of the API.
4. You are required to create a `.env` file that contains your OpenAI API Key and your selected port to be exposed by express.
    1. See `example.env`.
5. Copy over all your support documents inside the `/support` folder.
    1. By default, the chatbot API is already trained to answer from [Converge ICT Support Page](https://www.convergeict.com/support/).
6. Import the API module export to your website.
7. You now have successfully set up the chatbot API.

## Usage

### Example POST Request
```
const header = new Headers();
header.append('Content-Type', 'application/x-www-form-urlencoded');

const urlencoded = new URLSearchParams();
urlencoded.append('content', pushMessage);
urlencoded.append('language', 'tl');

const requestOptions = {
	method: 'POST',
	headers: header,
	body: urlencoded,
};

fetch('<address>/aid-bot', requestOptions)
	.then((response) => {
		if (response.ok) {
			return response.json();
		}
		else {
			return { response: null };
		}
	})
	.then((result) => {
		if (result.response) {
			// ...display chatbot response...
		}
		else {
			// ...handle missing response...
		}
	})
	.catch((error) => {
		console.log('error', error);
	});
```
